    <h2>The Atlas Complex</h2>
    <h4>by Olivie Blake</h4>
    
    <div class="content">
        The Atlas Complex marks the much-anticipated, heart-shattering conclusion in Olivie Blake's trilogy .Olivie Blake is the pseudonym of Alexene Farol Follmuth, a lover and writer of stories, many of which involve the fantastic, the paranormal, or the supernatural, but not always. More often, her works revolve around what it means to be human (or not), and the endlessly interesting complexities of life and love.<br>

        Only the extraordinary are chosen.<br>
        
        Only the cunning survive.<br>
        
        An explosive return to the library leaves the six Alexandrians vulnerable to the lethal terms of their recruitment.
        
        Old alliances quickly fracture as the initiates take opposing strategies as to how to deal with the deadly bargain they have so far failed to uphold. Those who remain with the archives wrestle with the ethics of their astronomical abilities, while elsewhere, an unlikely pair from the Society cohort partner to influence politics on a global stage.
        
        And still the outside world mobilizes to destroy them, while the Caretaker himself, Atlas Blakely, may yet succeed with a plan foreseen to have world-ending stakes. It’s a race to survive as the six Society recruits are faced with the question of what they're willing to betray for limitless power—and who will be destroyed along the way.
