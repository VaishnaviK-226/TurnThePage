    <h2>House of flame and shadow</h2>
    <h4>by Sarah J.Maas</h4>
    
    <div class="content">
        The stunning third book in the sexy, action-packed Crescent City series, following the global bestsellers 
    House of Earth and Blood and House of Sky and Breath.
Bryce Quinlan never expected to see a world other than Midgard, but now that she has, all she wants is to get back. 
Everything she loves is in Midgard: her family, her friends, her mate. 
Stranded in a strange new world, she's going to need all her wits about her to get home again.<br>
And that's no easy feat when she has no idea who to trust.<br>
Hunt Athalar has found himself in some deep holes in his life, but this one might be the deepest of all. 
After a few brief months with everything he ever wanted, he's in the Asteri's dungeons again, stripped of his freedom and without a clue as to Bryce's fate.
He's desperate to help her, but until he can escape the Asteri's leash, his hands are quite literally tied.
In this sexy, breathtaking sequel to the #1 bestsellers House of Earth and Blood and House of Sky and Breath,
 Sarah J. Maas's Crescent City series reaches new heights as Bryce and Hunt's world is brought to the brink of collapse-with its future resting on their shoulders.
